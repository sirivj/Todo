Heyy 👋 what’s up?

You said:
can we create a resume together
ChatGPT said:
Of course! 💼 Let’s do it together step by step.

To start, can you tell me:

What type of role you’re applying for (e.g., software developer, AI/ML intern, data analyst, etc.)

Whether you want it to be a fresh, new resume or to update an existing one you already have

Do you want it to be modern & creative, or clean & professional (like for corporate/tech roles)?

Once I know that, I’ll help you draft the structure and start filling it in with you.
